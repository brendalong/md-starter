## Highlights

* Headlines: use `#` through `######` for h1 - h6
* Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
* Blocks of code can be fenced by lines with three back-ticks ` ``` `

```
Here is a block without a language specified
```

Languages support and how those language names are written will vary from renderer to renderer.
```js
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
